    "# Processing sim data in 3D volume to 2D image\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to investigate in the reduction of the problem to 2d-image classification. We start from temporal data in 3d volume (simulation by CJ) and try to build a 2d-image representation of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this aim, we have to define certain parameters. In particular,\n",
    "- we've to choose the event time-horizon `T`\n",
    "- we've to choose the particles `P` that deposit energy that lead to scintillation\n",
    "- we've to choose the primary event `E0` that determines the start of the event\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can proceed as follow:\n",
    "1. scale the time w.r.t. the time of the primary event `E0`\n",
    "1. select the entries from particles `P` and time within the time-horizon `T`\n",
    "1. create a 2d-image and map each `Edep`>0 using `x`, `y` coordinates\n",
    "In fact, we can discard the `z` coordinate because the fibers are placed along the z-axis and all it will be impossible to distinguish the `z` coordinate from SiPM readouts."

    "## Define event time-horizon\n",
    "We analysed the time and space of muon passages in the [notebook] and observed that in the original pilot data, the muon cross the `4m` LAr volume in  less than ~`13ns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the other depositions could occur delayed in time. Then, we consider a greater time horizon of `20ns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[notebook]: analysis_muon_particles.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define particles that lead to scintillation\n",
    "Not all the energy deposited by any particles will lead to scintillation, indeed most of the energy deposition will then captured by other particles and so on. Some particles will directly cause the scintillation process, they are electrons `e-`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the fibers that are placed in the LAr volume will guide the optical photons to the SiPMs. The fibers will them capture two kind of photons:\n",
    "- primary photons, e.g. generated by Ar41 de-excitation\n",
    "- optical photons generated by scintillation\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at the current level of simulation we have no optical-photons entries because the scintillation process is not simulated. Then, considering this first stage of energy-deposition, we can focus our study on:\n",
    "- energy deposited by electrons\n",
    "- energy deposited by primary photons\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observation:\n",
    "1. Most of the primary photons will cause Compton scattering or Pair production, then producing electrons more or less directly. Then, primary photons will deposit their energy on the volume border releasing only a few `keV`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define primary event\n",
    "We can define as primary event, the first entry of a muon particle in the LAr volume. \n",
    "It could be a good choice because there is any relation between the time of the first muon entry in LAr and the energy deposition by the selected particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** once we will pass to feeding a ML model, we could also consider to introduce some time shifting in order to vary the observed events, maybe cutting some late depositions or anticipate some others. This could later improve the learning capability w.r.t. the time window.\n"
